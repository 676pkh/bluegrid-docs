# Concept of Page

<p>
In Bluegrid, a <b>page</b> is virtually a reference of a blueprint. A blueprint is a segment of a construction design. A blueprint may have one or multiple versions or updates. A page may hold zero or multiple corresponding PDF versions of the blueprint. A page is an entry point, a reference to every <b>Additional data</b> related to the page.
</p>
<p>
    Every page resides in one folder.
</p>

# Additional data
<p>
<b>Additional data</b> is the data generated in Bluegrid, by users such as shapes, markups, materials, etc. that are stored with referencing to a <b>page</b>. A page is the access point for all the additional data related to that page.
