To style shapes, we need to understand two types of shapes: Free shapes and tagged shapes. Free shapes are shapes which are not tagged with a material tag. Tagged shapes are shapes which are tagged with a material.

**1. Style free shapes**: Select shapes with select tool and change style properties of the shapes via free shape format toolbar:

**2. Style tagged shapes**: Once shapes are tagged with a material, the shape style is cascaded my the material. Please see [How to style material for more information](/material).
