A BlueGrid project file is with the extension .bgp. The file contains all the information of pdf blueprints, shapes, catalogs, materials and visualizations.

## Create
To create a new BlueGrid project from scratch, please follow these steps:

1. On the Starter window, click the `Create` button. This action will open a File dialog box.
2. In the File dialog box, navigate to the directory where you wish to save your project. If necessary, you can create a new subdirectory by clicking the `New Folder` button.
3. In the `File Name` text box, provide a name for your project. Ensure that the name is both descriptive and unique.
4. Click the `Save` button to finalize the creation of your project. This will close the File dialog box and the new project will be opened in BlueGrid.

## Open

You can open an existing BlueGrid project in two ways:

1. If the project is not listed in the Starter window, click the `Open` button and navigate to the project file.
2. If the project is listed in the Starter window, double-click the project name to open it. This option is convenient when you want to reopen a project that you have recently worked on. The Starter window displays the names and locations of the projects that you have previously created or opened. To remove a project from the list, hover over the project item in the list and click the cross icon.

Upon opening a project, BlueGrid will display the [Document view](../application/#document-view).
