### Open a project

You can open an existing BlueGrid project in two ways:

1. If the project is not listed in the Start window, click the Open button and navigate to the project file. 
2. If the project is listed in the Start window, double-click the project name to open it. This option is convenient when you want to reopen a project that you have recently worked on.
The Start window shows the names and locations of the projects that you have created or opened before. To remove a project from the list, hover to the project item in the list and click the cross icon. 

When you open a project, BlueGrid will show Documents view. You can switch to Draw view, Catalogs view, or open a page to start quantity take-off or markups.
