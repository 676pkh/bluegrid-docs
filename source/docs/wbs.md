With BlueGrid you can create, import and export for re-use, sharing work breakdown structure (W.B.S) in tree-like format. In BlueGrid a W.B.S is a catalog. One BlueGrid project you can have multiple catalogs .
A catalog is a tree-like structure, so it must have a top parent item and all others items are its children items. Each catalog item has its type of eighth Group or Material.  
A group item itself can have child items. The root item is a group item. A material item is a leaf in the tree structure of the catalog, it does not have child items.

   1. Go to Catalogs view
   2. In catalogs list, from catalogs list menu select "Create catalog" menu
   3. Select the catalog name to open its tree-view, from the tree-view menu select menu "Add root".
