##  Application data
> ### Application setting profile:
Users can customize the look and feel of the application, modify shortcut keys, and export custom settings data to a profile file and save it in a safe location. These settings can be reused later by importing the data from the profile file. This feature is especially useful when BlueGrid is updated, as all previous application data is cleared during the update process.
> ### Symbol tools:
Symbols are tools that users can define, add, and delete. They are part of the application data and are cleared when BlueGrid updates. Users should save their symbols by exporting them to a file, which can be reused later by importing the file.

## Project data
All project data is stored in the BlueGrid project file (.bgp). The data file should be kept in a safe location where BlueGrid has read and write permissions. More details about the project data can be found in the [Project](../project) section.
