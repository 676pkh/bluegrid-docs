In BlueGrid standard edition, shape tools are tools to draw almost any 2D shapes that are usually used in construction blueprints, such as line
, rectangle, polygon, spline, path, shapes with wholes in side..etc. Metric values are derived from rendered visuals (what you see is what you get).
While drawing, to get the best accuracy, you should turn on point snap options.

**1. Line tool:** A line is instituted from arbitrary two different points. To draw a line, select line tool, and pick two points.

**2. Polyline tool:** A polyline is instituted from at least two points. To draw a polyline, select polyline tool, and pick at least two points, you can pick as many points as possible.

**3. Polygon tool:** A polygon is instituted from at least three points. A polygon is quite similar to a polyline, except that it is always a close shape. That means the start point and the end point are identical. To draw a polygon, select polygon tool, and pick at least three points, you can pick as many points as possible.

**4. Rectangle tool:** To draw a rectangle pick two oposite corners of the rectangle.

**5. Circle tool:** BlueGrid provide two draw a circle. The first option allows you to draw a circle picking two points, one is the center and a the second is any point on the perimeter of the circle. The second option allows you to draw a circle of picking three arbitrary different 3 points on the perimeter of the circle.

**6. Ellipse tool:** To draw an ellipse, pick the center of the ellipse and then pick any corner of the virtual rectangle bounds of the ellipse.

**7. Arc tool:** An arc (circle arc) is a segment of the subcribe circle. To draw an arce, pick three different points on the arc.

**8. Quad curve tool:** A quadratic curve is derived from three different points. To draw a quad curve, pick three different points.

**8. Cubic curve tool:** A cubic curve is derived from four different points. To draw a quad curve, pick four different points.

**9. Path tool:** A path is a complex shape, it renders a shape with multiple kind of segments such line, skip (empty distance), quadratic segments, cubic segments, arc segments, and with zero or multiple wholes inside. To use different segment kinds while drawing a path, you switch to path mode as required. You can switch directly from path mode choice box or switch by using shortcut keys. Below is path mode shortcut keys table:

| Key  | Mode                     | Draw                    | 
| :----| :------------------------|:----------------------- |
| 0    | Move to (skip/jump) mode | Pick one point          |
| 1    | Line segment mode        | Pick one more point     |
| 2    | Quad segment mode        | Pick two more point     |
| 3    | Cubic segment mode       | Pick three more point   |
| 4    | Arc segment mode         | Pick twoo more point    |
| 5    | Close mode               |                         |
| Space| Cancel last segmentt     |                         |
