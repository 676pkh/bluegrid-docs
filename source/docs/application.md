# Application

> *This section provides an overview of the application, its user interface, and its components. Each component will be accompanied by a reference to its detailed documentation for usage instructions.*


<br>

Application is the main window of BlueGrid, where users perform quantity take-off projects.

Operations within the application occur at the project level. This implies that any changes made within the application are applied directly to the project data. This project data is then stored within the project file.

The application features a [Navigation bar](#navigation-bar) and 3 views: [Document view](#document-view), [Draw view](#draw-view), and [Catalog view](#catalog-view). At a given time, only one of these views is displayed. [Document-view](#document-view) is the default view when users open the application. Users can switch between views using the [Navigation bar](#navigation-bar).

With these tools use can change style properties such as color, line width, opacity, font, font size, etc. of free shapes, texts, or annotations. Tagged shapes are not affected by these tools as they are not free shapes. Tagged shapes are style by their styling tags such as [materials](/material).
 
### Draw canvas
```Navigation: Application | Draw view | Draw canvas```

[Draw canvas](#draw-canvas) is the central component of the [Draw view](#draw-view). The [Draw canvas](#draw-canvas) is layered with a PDF view and a drawing pane which allows users to draw shapes on the PDF page. It is equipped with numerous features and functionalities to facilitate the drawing process.

Shapes of Metric class, drawn by users are used to compute metric values such as count, length, area, and volume. These shapes can be tagged to materials to compute quantity of those materials. 

Shapes of Annotation class, drawn by users are not used to compute metric values. These shapes can not be tagged to materials; they are always free shapes and are formatted using [Free shapes format toolbar](#free-shapes-format-toolbar).

### Left Panel
```Navigation: Application | Draw View | Left Panel```

Left Panel is a panel that allows users to switch to between tab panes of the Draw View. These tabs contain tools and data that co-relate to Draw Canvas's data. The data displayed is at page level. There are 3 tabs: [Draw Tab](#draw-tab), [Material Tab](#material-tab), and [Layer Tab](#layer-tab).
