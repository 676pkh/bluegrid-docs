# Starter
<p>
Starter is the entry window of Bluegrid. From the Starter users open a project, create a project, modify shortcut keys, or customize looks and feels as well as set application parameters to optimize usage experience.
</p>
Operations in the Starter are at application level. This means that the changes made in the Starter are applied to the application as a whole, not to a specific project. Data of application is stored in the settings profile file.
