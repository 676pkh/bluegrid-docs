# Starter
Starter is the entry window of Bluegrid. From the starter users open, create, modify shortcut keys, or customize looks and feels as well as set application parameters to optimize usage experience.

Operations in the Starter are at application level. This means that the changes made in the Starter are applied to the application as a whole, not to a specific project. Data of application is stored in the settings profile file.
