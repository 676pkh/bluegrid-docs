## Draw shapes
<p>
In BlueGrid standard, shape tools are tools used to draw almost any type of 2D shapes that are usually used in construction blueprints, such as line, rectangle, polygon, spline, path, shapes with wholes in side...etc. All shapes drawn using shape tools have metric values and can subscribe to material tags. Metric values are derived from shapes as rendered visuals.

While drawing, to get the best accuracy, point snaps should be on.

<procedure title="Polyline tool" id="polyline-tool">
<p>
A polyline is a connected sequence of line segments created as a single shape. A polyline has at least two or many vertices. In BlueGrid, drawing a polyline is to pick all the vertices of the polyline, in ordered sequence.
</p>
<step>
Select the <code>Polyline tool</code> from the <code>Draw tool pane</code>.
</step>
<step>
Click left mouse button on the <code>Draw board</code> to pick the first vertex of the polyline. By picking the first vertex, there will an extra active vertex which is always move with the mouse cursor.
</step>
<step>
Repeat the second step to pick the next vertex of the polyline, and so on.
</step>
<step>
To finish drawing the polyline, right mouse click <code>draw board</code> to remove the active extra vertex and finish the polyline.
</step>
</procedure>
