# Draw

## Draw shapes
<p>
In BlueGrid standard, shape tools are tools used to draw almost any type of 2D shapes that are usually used in construction blueprints, such as line, rectangle, polygon, spline, path, shapes with wholes in side...etc. All shapes drawn using shape tools have metric values and can subscribe to material tags. Metric values are derived from shapes as rendered visuals.

While drawing, to get the best accuracy, point snaps should be on.
