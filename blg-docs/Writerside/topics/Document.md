# PDFs
<p>
In BlueGrid, PDF blueprints are the base data that every project must have for users to perform take-off or markup tasks. Data layers of shapes, markups, materials etc..are built and stored on top of PDF pages and are accessed via PDF pages. PDF pages are the reference points for all those data. 
</p>
## Folders

## Pages

### Concept of Page
<p>
In Bluegrid, a page is virtually a reference of a blueprint. A blueprint is a piece of construction design. A blueprint may have one or multiple versions or updates. A page may hold zero or multiple PDF versions of the blueprint. A page is an entry, a reference to every <b>Additional data</b> added to the page.
</p>
<p>
    Every page resides in one folder.
</p>

### Additional data
<p>
Additional data is the data generated in Bluegrid such as shapes, markups, materials, etc. that are stored with referencing to a page. A page is the access point for all the additional data related to the page.
